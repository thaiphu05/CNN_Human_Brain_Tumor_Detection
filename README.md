# Brain Tumor Detection Project

This is a small project about Brain Tumor detection using `Kaggle` dataset.
I used CNN with 2 Conv2D layers which have 64 and 32 matrices.

Dataset source: [`Kaggle` Brain MRI Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection?resource=download)
